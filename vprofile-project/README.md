**VProfile Project**

This project demonstrates a multi-tier web application deployed
using different provisioning approaches.

**Provisioning Approaches**
- Manual Provisioning
- Automatic Provisioning (Vagrant + Shell )
- Docker-based Provisioning

Each approach is documented in its respective directory.

**Note:** This project is part of a learning course and was implemented for educational
and practice purposes. The original concept and design belong to the course
creator. The implementation, setup, and documentation were done by me as part
of hands-on learning.

**Learning Outcomes**

- Hands-on experience with multi-tier application architecture
- Infrastructure provisioning using Vagrant
- Understanding of load balancing, caching, and message queues
- Docker containers implementaion
